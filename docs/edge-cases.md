# Edge-case showcase

**Status:** Contract matrix — implementation tracked in proposal P7 (`LSM-EDGE-*`).

What breaks when you hand-roll stream orchestration, and how `llm-stream-mux` pins behavior. For positioning vs generic utilities, see [comparison](./comparison.md).

---

## A) Native `ReadableStream.tee()` unbounded memory

If one branch reads slowly, native `tee()` buffers **without limit** for the slow branch while the fast branch races ahead.

**What mux does:** `tee()` with `block`, `bounded`, or `drop` policies (D5). `bounded` errors the lagging branch; `drop` drops oldest queued items.

**Tests (planned):** `LSM-TEE-03`, `LSM-TEE-04`.

---

## B) Race without `isUsable` — junk-first wins

A source that emits an empty or metadata frame before real content can win a naive “first emit” race.

**What mux does:** optional `isUsable` gates the winner; pre-usable items are **buffered and flushed in order** once a source wins (§7.3).

**Tests (planned):** `LSM-RACE-02`, `LSM-RACE-03`.

---

## C) Fallback after partial output — commit point

You cannot “un-send” bytes already forwarded. Failover after commit would splice two streams into one incoherent response.

**What mux does:** `FailoverPolicy` — default `"commit"` fails over only **before** the first forwarded (usable) item; post-commit errors propagate. `"buffered"` and `"post-emit"` trade latency for cleanliness (§7.2).

**Tests (planned):** `LSM-FB-03`–`LSM-FB-05`.

---

## D) Merge `Promise.race` naïveté — dropped reads

A naïve merge loop that `Promise.race`s pending reads **loses** settled values from sources that did not win the race.

**What mux does:** one pending read per source in a `Map`; re-arm only after consume (proposal §21 implementation note).

**Tests (planned):** `LSM-MERGE-08`.

---

## E) AsyncIterable “cancel” is soft

Calling `return()` on an async iterator does not guarantee the underlying HTTP request stops.

**What mux does:** documents cancellation honesty (§7.5); recommends `ReadableStream` sources when hard cancel matters; losers get `MuxCancelled` reason objects.

**Tests (planned):** `LSM-CORE-*`, `LSM-RACE-*` cancel assertions.

---

## F) P0 type surface edge cases (frozen at scaffold)

The public API is **generic over `T`** — errors cannot be synthesized as `T`, so merge uses `Tagged<T>` with explicit `kind` variants. These are pinned at P0 before runtime strategies exist:

| Case                                           | Risk                             | P0 pin                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Tagged` used as plain union without narrowing | Access `value` on `error` branch | `LSM-TYP-01`–`03` discriminant tests          |
| `ALL_FAILED` without `errors[]`                | Loses per-source diagnostics     | `LSM-TYP-04` aggregate shape                  |
| `Sources` labeled vs positional confusion      | Wrong `source` tags in merge     | `LSM-TYP-06` three input forms                |
| Lazy thunk invoked at call site                | Breaks failover cost model       | `LSM-TYP-07` deferred invocation              |
| `fromAsyncIterable` alias creep                | Violates D10                     | `LSM-REL-02` export denial                    |
| Premature `race()` stub in public API          | False semver promise             | `LSM-REL-02` strategy export denial           |
| `MuxErrorCode` drift vs `MUX_ERROR_CODES`      | Telemetry/SIEM mismatch          | `LSM-REL-02`, `LSM-TYP-16`–`21`, `LSM-TYP-45` |
| `dist/index.d.ts` missing exports / leaks API  | Broken consumers                 | `LSM-TYP-51`, `LSM-TYP-52`                    |
| Matrix error codes before runtime exists       | Spec drift vs implementation     | `LSM-EDGE-P0-01`–`26`                         |
| Hook composition / policy literals             | Wrong defaults at call site      | `LSM-TYP-30`–`35`                             |
| Byte vs event generic `T`                      | Accidental event model coupling  | `LSM-TYP-23`, `LSM-TYP-24`                    |
| Fn signature types (Race/Merge/Tee/interop)    | Wrong consumer typings at P1     | `LSM-TYP-55`–`58`                             |
| Source union runtime (empty/cancel/lazy)       | Broken edge matrix at P7         | `LSM-SRC-01`–`08`                             |
| `MUX_ERROR_CODES` mutability                   | Telemetry enum drift             | `LSM-TYP-63`                                  |

## G) Contract matrix (binding at P7)

| Case                            | race               | fallback                | merge                        | tee            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| empty `sources` (`[]`)          | `NO_USABLE_SOURCE` | `ALL_FAILED` (0 errors) | yields nothing, completes    | n/a            |
| single source                   | pass-through       | pass-through            | tagged pass-through          | works          |
| all sources empty               | `NO_USABLE_SOURCE` | `ALL_FAILED`            | all `done`, completes        | branches close |
| source throws before first item | disqualified       | failover                | `error` tag, others continue | per policy     |
| consumer breaks early (`break`) | cancel all         | cancel active           | cancel all sources           | branch rules   |
| `signal` already aborted        | `ABORTED`          | `ABORTED`               | `ABORTED`                    | branches error |

Each cell → `LSM-EDGE-NN` in `test/edge.test.ts` (P7).

## H) Prove it locally (after P1+)

Once helpers land in `test/helpers/streams.ts`:

```ts
import { race } from "llm-stream-mux";
import { fromArray } from "../test/helpers/streams"; // P1

const { asyncIterable: junkFirst } = fromArray([new Uint8Array(0), new Uint8Array([1])], {
	delayMs: 0,
});
const { asyncIterable: slowGood } = fromArray([new Uint8Array([42])], { delayMs: 50 });

for await (const chunk of race([junkFirst, slowGood], {
	isUsable: (c) => c.byteLength > 0,
})) {
	console.log(chunk); // [42] from slowGood after junk buffered on winner
}
```
