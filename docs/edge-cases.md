# Edge-case showcase

**Status:** Contract matrix — P7 implemented (`0.7.0`) — **`LSM-EDGE-01`–`99`** + **`LSM-REL-09`** in `test/edge.test.ts`.

What breaks when you hand-roll stream orchestration, and how `llm-stream-mux` pins behavior. For positioning vs generic utilities, see [comparison](./comparison.md).

---

## A) Native `ReadableStream.tee()` unbounded memory

If one branch reads slowly, native `tee()` buffers **without limit** for the slow branch while the fast branch races ahead.

**What mux does:** `tee()` with `block`, `bounded`, or `drop` policies (D5). `bounded` errors the lagging branch; `drop` drops oldest queued items.

**Tests:** `LSM-TEE-03`, `LSM-TEE-04` (block), `LSM-TEE-05`–`07` / `LSM-TEE-36` / `LSM-TEE-48`–`51` / `LSM-TEE-62` (bounded), `LSM-TEE-08`–`09` / `LSM-TEE-42` / `LSM-TEE-49` / `LSM-TEE-57` (drop), `LSM-TEE-38` / `LSM-TEE-61` (natural close ≠ cancel), `LSM-TEE-43`–`46` (arg validation), `LSM-TEE-52`–`55` / `LSM-TEE-60` / `LSM-TEE-63`–`64` (cancel semantics).

---

## B) Race without `isUsable` — junk-first wins

A source that emits an empty or metadata frame before real content can win a naive “first emit” race.

**What mux does:** optional `isUsable` gates the winner; pre-usable items are **buffered and flushed in order** once a source wins (§7.3).

**Tests:** `LSM-RACE-02`, `LSM-RACE-03`, `LSM-RACE-04`, `LSM-RACE-48`, `LSM-RACE-58`, `LSM-RACE-79`.

---

## C) Fallback after partial output — commit point

You cannot “un-send” bytes already forwarded. Failover after commit would splice two streams into one incoherent response.

**What mux does:** `FailoverPolicy` — default `"commit"` fails over only **before** the first forwarded (usable) item; post-commit errors propagate. `"buffered"` and `"post-emit"` trade latency for cleanliness (§7.2).

**Tests:** `LSM-FB-03`–`LSM-FB-06`, `LSM-FB-41`, `LSM-FB-76`–`LSM-FB-110`.

---

## D) Merge `Promise.race` naïveté — dropped reads

A naïve merge loop that `Promise.race`s pending reads **loses** settled values from sources that did not win the race.

**What mux does:** one pending read per source in a `Map`; re-arm only after consume (proposal §21 implementation note).

**Tests:** `LSM-MERGE-08`, `LSM-MERGE-71`, `LSM-MERGE-87`, `LSM-MERGE-103`.

---

## E) AsyncIterable “cancel” is soft

Calling `return()` on an async iterator does not guarantee the underlying HTTP request stops.

**What mux does:** documents cancellation honesty (§7.5); recommends `ReadableStream` sources when hard cancel matters; losers get `MuxCancelled` reason objects.

**Tests (planned):** `LSM-CORE-05`–`07`, `LSM-CORE-23` (P1); full strategy cancel in P2+.

---

## F) P0 type surface edge cases (frozen at scaffold)

The public API is **generic over `T`** — errors cannot be synthesized as `T`, so merge uses `Tagged<T>` with explicit `kind` variants. These are pinned at P0 before runtime strategies exist:

| Case                                           | Risk                              | P0 pin                                                                                   |

## G) Contract matrix (binding — P7 `0.7.0`)

| Case                            | race               | fallback                | merge                        | tee            | Test ID        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| empty `sources` (`[]`)          | `NO_USABLE_SOURCE` | `ALL_FAILED` (0 errors) | yields nothing, completes    | n/a            | `01`/`02`/`03` |
| single source                   | pass-through       | pass-through            | tagged pass-through          | works          | `04`–`07`      |
| all sources empty               | `NO_USABLE_SOURCE` | `ALL_FAILED`            | all `done`, completes        | branches close | `08`–`11`      |
| source throws before first item | disqualified       | failover                | `error` tag, others continue | per policy     | `12`–`15`      |
| consumer breaks early (`break`) | cancel all         | cancel active           | cancel all sources           | branch rules   | `16`–`19`      |
| `signal` already aborted        | `ABORTED`          | `ABORTED`               | `ABORTED`                    | branches error | `20`–`23`      |

**Row 1 supplements:** empty `Record` `{}` → **`LSM-EDGE-52`** (race), **`LSM-EDGE-53`** (fallback); single empty stream in array → **`LSM-EDGE-51`** (async race).

**Authority:** `test/edge.test.ts` — canonical **`LSM-EDGE-*`** pins (strategy tests remain informative cross-refs).

## H) Prove it locally (after P1+)

Once helpers land in `test/helpers/streams.ts`:

```ts
import { race } from "llm-stream-mux";
import { fromArray } from "../test/helpers/streams"; // P1

const { asyncIterable: junkFirst } = fromArray([new Uint8Array(0), new Uint8Array([1])], {
	delayMs: 0,
});
const { asyncIterable: slowGood } = fromArray([new Uint8Array([42])], { delayMs: 50 });

for await (const chunk of race([junkFirst, slowGood], {
	isUsable: (c) => c.byteLength > 0,
})) {
	console.log(chunk); // [42] from slowGood after junk buffered on winner
}
```

---

## Cross-cutting options (P6 — `0.6.0`)

Shared **`CommonOptions`** on **`race`**, **`fallback`**, and **`merge`/`ensemble`**.

| Option                    | Scope                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`timeoutMs`**           | Per-source **time-to-first-usable** on **`race`** + **`fallback`** only; **`merge` ignores**             |
| **`overallTimeoutMs`**    | Whole-operation deadline on all three async strategies → consumer **`ABORTED`** with **`TIMEOUT`** cause |
| **`highWaterMark`**       | Output coordinator queue depth (default **`1`**)                                                         |
| **`sourceHighWaterMark`** | Per-source input buffering on **`ReadableStream`** adapters only                                         |

Timers start on **first consumer `.next()`**, not at strategy call site.

**Tests:** `LSM-X-01`–`115`, `LSM-CORE-61`–`70`, `LSM-REL-08a/b`.
